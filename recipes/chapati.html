    <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Kenyan chapati is a popular flatbread that is soft, layered, and slightly chewy, 
        with a golden-brown, crispy exterior. Made from wheat flour, water, salt, and sometimes 
        a little oil or ghee, the dough is rolled out, folded, and then rolled again to create 
        thin layers.</p>
        
        <p>It is traditionally cooked on a hot griddle until both sides are well browned. Chapati is a 
        staple in many Kenyan households and is often served with stews, vegetables, or meat dishes, 
        making it a versatile and beloved component of Kenyan cuisine.</p>
