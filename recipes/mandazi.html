        <h2>Description</h2>

            <p>Kenyan mandazi is a popular East African snack that resembles a doughnut but is less sweet 
            and denser. It is a type of fried bread made from a dough of flour, sugar, and other 
            ingredients, which is cut into triangles or other shapes and deep-fried until golden brown.</p>
        
            <p>Mandazi can be enjoyed on its own, with tea, or as a complement to other dishes. 
            It's a common breakfast or snack item in Kenyan households and is known for its 
            slightly sweet, subtly spiced flavor.</p>
